Personal Statement

Coming from a country with deep social and economic inequalities, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by micro-entrepreneurs, especially in the remote forest regions of Brazil. I believe that information technologies and artificial intelligence are powerful tools for empowering local communities, improving access to education, investment opportunities, and strengthening microeconomies.
Through international research opportunities, I aim to deepen my technical expertise and contribute innovative ideas that create concrete benefits for underrepresented populations, aligned with the latest global technology trends.
